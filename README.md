# percolation
This is a python implementation of the famous percolation problem and an algorithm that quickly resolves any query in log2(n) time. This program simulates percolating through randomly opened squares on a grid called "sites". Scientists have modeled that around 57% is the tipping point for the amount of open sites in order for the grid to percolate, or have an open path from top to bottom. This program simulates and tries to prove this number.
